            As a special exception, if you link this library with files
            compiled with a GNU compiler to produce an executable, this
            does not cause the resulting executable to be covered by
            the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
            however invalidate any other reasons why the executable
            file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
